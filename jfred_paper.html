<b>
I. Introduction
</b>
<p>
Since the coming of electronic calculators, Man has longed to create
machines with which he could converse freely. In 1950 the English logician
Alan Turing hypothesized the near-future existence and reinforcement of 
the dialectical relationship between man and machine <a href="paper1_5.html#1">[1]</a>. In support of 
this, Turing asserted that if it should become true that a common man, by
holding a dialogue with a machine hidden from his sight, could get even 
the impression of talking with another person, then that event would 
sanction the origin of so-called Artificial Intelligence (AI).
<p>
Strategies for substantiating Turing's assertion can be twofold. On one 
hand, the field of AI feels compelled to demonstrate a medium wherein man
can no longer distinguish the real nature of his interlocutor. On the other
hand, computer science in general strives to embed forms of knowledge and 
deductive reasoning within the context of machines typically used for 
mathematical calculations or control systems. 
<p>
Experiments performed in these terms will lead to very different results 
and considerations. The real problem is, however, to ponder whether it 
is possible to design machines equipped with a certain measure of 
"personality".
<p>
Transferring the question on the subject of "man" to that of "machine", 
and borrowing ideas from theorists like Minsky and Hofstadter <a href="paper1_5.html#2">[2]</a>, we 
could identify the human brain as an hardware medium which runs a set 
of opportunistic "software modules", representing what is usually called 
"mind".
<p>
Similarly convincing motivations exist on the opposite side of this 
question, like those of the American philosopher Searle <a href="paper1_5.html#3">[3]</a> in his 
proposition of the "Chinese Room". According to Searle, if we assume 
that a computer can reproduce the behaviour of an individual who is a
native Chinese speaker, this doesn't imply, from a cognitive point of
view, that the computer is identical to that person -- not even if the
computer could imitate the person's characteristics perfectly.
<p>
Therefore, one need not question whether a machine can be perfected to 
deceive the humans with whom it conducts dialogue. It suffices that a 
machine can "place itself in a human's shoes", and at the same time 
increase its knowledge, thanks to an information exchange which the 
human interlocutor provides.
<p>
<b>
II. ELIZA and The Modern Intelligent Agents
</b>
<p>
Fortunately, these ideas do not belong solely to the world of science 
fiction or fantasy, not since Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA in 1966, 
as the first software capable of conversing with a human <a href="paper1_5.html#4">[4]</a>.
<p>
More recently the so-called "intelligent agents" (or "software robots")
have emerged, able to converse about various issues and topics <a href="paper1_5.html#5">[5]</a> <a href="paper1_5.html#6">[6]</a>.
These systems substantiate the concept of Virtual Personality -- a 
prerequisite for any machine that would claim to simulate human thought. 
Mikhail Gorbachov, Dante Alighieri, even Jesus Christ <a href="paper1_5.html#7">[7]</a> have been
"interpreted" by such agents.
<p>
Here the dialectic and symbiosis between humans and machines becomes 
total: not only because man is persuaded (by being deceived), nor 
simply because the other may exhibit human-like behaviour, but above 
all because the machine, by means of its virtual personality, can 
interpret and learn from what the human interlocutor attempts to 
communicate.
<p>
In other words, the dialogue becomes a kind of "interview game", i.e.
a conversation based on successive volleys in the form "user question
vs. machine answer". Also, an intelligent agent will tend to adapt to
questions from the interviewer, modifying its element of humour according 
to the perceived conversational tone of the interlocutor (friendly, 
formal, aggressive). In this way the machine can show a personality 
very close to that of a human.
<p>
<b>
III. Intelligent Agents for the Web: Presentation
</b>
<p>
One application of the JFRED intelligent agent software described in this
paper stemmed from involvement with a media collective, FringeWare Inc., 
operating as a business on the Internet. The firm did not have sufficient
budget to provide for customer service staff, and was forced to improvise.
<p>
Note that realization of customer service online differs significantly 
from service provided via telephone, both in terms of the structure of the 
medium and customer expectations. Online, sheer numbers of people can 
overwhelm a firm's service staff, and the notion of a "busy signal" is 
rarely tolerated. Whereas a busy signal on a telephone line indicates that
the caller should try again later, a "Host not responding" error in a web
browser signifies the ambiguous condition that either the address is 
invalid, or the server is down, or too many people have attempted to 
contact the server. Attention and demand for an Internet site can force
situations where the subject experiences a loss of identity <a href="paper1_5.html#8">[8]</a> <a href="paper1_5.html#9">[9]</a>.
<p>
Consequently the firm's owners decided to use intelligent agents to 
provide first-tier customer support via the Internet, beginning in 
late 1992. Many common navigation tools were incorporated into the
Web site, but some percentage of incoming customers demand interaction,
especially in the form of conversation. Experience has shown that most 
people who fall into in the latter category tend to be those who:
<p>
<i>
<li>are confused about the site's intent
<li>prefer to browse and tend not transact real business
<li>just want to chat
</i>
<p>
These needs can be served by an intelligent agent, acting as a natural
language interface for a local search engine and other navigation tools,
especially one that attempts to evoke personality and humour. Additionally,
agents log their conversations, which can be reviewed by a human later, 
as a second-tier of customer relations. A human operator might choose to
contact a customer directly, e.g. if their questions seem very urgent.
Over the course of five years, several methods for hosting conversations
between agents and human customers have been investigated, including:
<p>
<i>
<li>automated response to incoming email
<li>HTML forms, with the agent running via Common Gateway Interface
<li>a Java applet encapsulating a subset of a particular agent
<li>as a player within a variant of LambdaMOO
<li>a multi-threaded Java application running on a TCP port
</i>
<p>
The latter method proved most effective, both for reducing and consolidating
the source code to maintain, and in terms of response rates.
<p>
An application, written in Java, implements a server which listens on a
specific TCP port. Java was selected as the programming language of 
choice, due to its innate ability to manipulate network connections,
ease of program development, and inherent multi-platform source code
portability <a href="paper1_5.html#10">[10]</a>.
<p>
One Java class determines the use of grammar within an agent, and can be
swapped out to allow for different natural languages, without the need 
for restructuring the system. Java's object inheritance readily allows
for effecting dialects as well.
<p>
A simple protocol (similar to that used by email servers <a hre="paper1_5.html#11">[11]</a>) allows the
agent to accept data outside its normal stream of conversation. This 
provides for tracking the identity of the interlocutor between successive
web page requests, by using a "cookie" <a href="paper1_5.html#12">[12]</a>. Persistent data is interjected
into conversation via specialized rules, using a simplified version of
frame-based learning <a href="paper1_5.html#13">[13]</a>. Moreover, frames allow for sequencing of 
responses, so that the agent can maintain the flow of a conversation.
Initial settings for many frame variables, e.g. email address, country
of origin, etc., can be guessed using international "whois" services to
decode TCP addresses <a href="paper1_5.html#14">[14]</a>.
<p>
Program execution for JFRED itself is based on a simple algorithm:
<p>
<pre>
	create an instance of the grammar object
	load a list of rules files
	listen on the TCP port
<p>
	per each TCP connection:
		fork off a new execution thread
		initialize rule set
		accept "cookie" via protocol
		load frame based on "cookie"
		transact with interlocutor
<p>
		per each input phrase read:
			fuzzy logic selects rule to best describe input
			save variables into frame, if any can be parsed
			remap verb tenses and prepositions, if needed
			return the response
</pre>
<p>
This describes a framework surrounding the natural language processing.
This is essential, and can become quite a complex task. Consider that 
the system must run within the context of a distributed, multi-user, 
client/server, and allegedly "stateless" transaction model required by
the World Wide Web.
<p>
Our natural language component itself employs fuzzy logic rules to pair
input phrases with candidate responses. Sets of rules, specified in simple
text files, determine the behaviour of an agent, apart from its use of
grammar. These rules map keyword counts and regular expressions found 
within an input phrase into fuzzy membership sets used to describe the
semantics of the phrase <a href="paper1_5.html#15">[15]</a>. The processing includes:
<p>
<i>
<li>determining fuzzy sets of keywords
<li>parsing grammatical constructs (regular expressions)
<li>frame-based knowledge of country, currency, language
<li>internal state for tone of the conversation
</i>
<p>
Some rules extract data from the conversation, e.g. "What is your name?",
others invoke regionally-based insults depending on conversational tone, 
while other rules resolve fuzzy membership sets into ordered lists of
candidate responses, interrogations, and suggested URLs.
<p>
Arguably simple compared with other works, but the simplicity of this 
method allows non-technical staff to author additions to the agent. For
example, a default rule set might describe customer service responses in
general, e.g. where to find sources for more information. Then an
employee could create additional rules for the agent to discuss upcoming
events, news items, topical personality quirks, etc.
<p>
The natural language agent fits within a context of a larger system
architecture being developed through 1997. Another key component is a MOO
(an implementation of the popular LambdaMOO system <a href="paper1_5.html#16">[16]</a>) which provides an 
object-oriented framework for describing the online space. The MOO server 
also manages persistent identities (login/password) for staff, agents, and 
repeat customers. A system of databases drives the design and creation of 
the Web site, automatically generated HTML pages and VRML objects <a href="paper1_5.html#17">[17]</a>, in
turn cross-referenced with content from back issues of the firm's magazine
and longstanding email list. Additional intelligent agents serve to:
<p>
<i>
<li>create local search engine indices
<li>check consistency for URLs and graphics
<li>derive global currency exchanges and postal rates
<li>verify customer address information
<li>generate site usage reports
<li>alert "anti-spam" packet filters
<li>intelligently parsing email errors
</i>
<p>
The latter two agents serve as a kind of lymphatic system for the Internet
server <a href="paper1_5.html#18">[18]</a> <a href="paper1_5.html">[19]</a>.
<p>
<b>
IV. Intelligent Agents for the Web: Results
</b>
<p>
The research and development of JFRED represents an ongoing project, spanning
over the past 16 years <a href="paper1_5.html#20">[20]</a>. This effort has been reviewed favorably in the 
context of the many intelligent agents exhibiting personality on the Web <a href="paper1_5.html#21">[21]</a>.
An example conversation with the intelligent agent Barry DeFacto, based on 
some of the latest JFRED software, is shown below. Note the use of persistent
learned data, stored in a frame format:
<p>
<i>
<pre>
	name: Ryan
	country: United States
	language: English
	currency: Dollar
	city: San Diego
	province: CA
	postcode: 92101
	provider: ElectriCiti, Inc.
<p>	
	human> HI
	barry> What do you want?
	human> whats your name?
	barry> I'm Barry.
	human> How old are you?
	barry> I am 33 earth years old.
	human> my name is ryan
	barry> Yes, I think that your name is Ryan.
	human> your right
	barry> Are you seeing any bots besides me? is that how they say it in San Diego?
	human> well, I'm looking for some. but your the best so far
</pre>
</i>
<p>
The "city" variable has been derived from an international database and 
is used in conversation. The "name" variable is learned, then repeated
in conversation.
<p>
One primary intent for Barry was to explore the use of programmed
personalities. One of Barry's authors predicted that, since the host 
web server was located in Austin, Texas, some people would want to 
talk about local culture. Here the agent references an album by 
local artist Daniel Johnston, entitled "Hi, How Are You?": 
<p>
<i>
<pre>
	name: Strange person with no name
	email: user@lily.singnet.com.sg
	country: Singapore
	language: Malay
	currency: Dollar
	provider: com.sg
<p>	
	human> Hi how are you?
	barry> Just fine. You remind me of Daniel Johnston.
	human> Who is daniel?
	barry> He is a musician in Austin, Texas.
	human> I've never been to Texas.
</i>
</pre>
<p>
An ironic result of Barry's use of personality has been the judgement 
people make about agents' differing levels of intelligence based on
their graphic representation. For example, an interlocuter tried both
Barry DeFacto and a related agent Stig, which features different graphics,
(including some animation) but does not access as much database knowledge
as Barry. Regardless, Stig has been remarked to be more intelligent
based on the appearance.
<p>
Likewise, people who converse with an intelligent agent have remark on
an agent's personality without accepting that human-like quality as a 
measure of intelligence <a href="paper1_5.html#22">[22]</a>. This speaks to the point of Turing's original
criteria, as opposed to the use of personality.
<p>
Other people benefit once they learn how to get along with Barry, i.e. 
once they adapt to the agent's mode of conversation. This effect provides 
counterpoint to Turing's charge that a human need be deceived by a
computer.
<p>
A magazine reporter in New York recently participated in a staged Turing
Test, in which Barry had been one of the finalist competitors. The reporter
later wrote about the experience, which prompted lengthy discussions online
via the magazine's web site: people would talk with Barry, then discuss
issues with Barry's authors <a href="paper1_5.html#23">[23]</a>. One early detractor reversed his opinion 
based on adaptation to the agent:
<p>
<i>
<pre>
	AndyHavoc - 10:15pm May 21, 1997 PST (#38 of 40)
<p>	
	I can foresee what Robby (and Paco) are doing now turning into
	something akin to the interface of the Enterprises computer. You 
	ask a question in plain English. It searches it's database and 
	gives you an answer in plain English. 
<p>	
	I've been playing with Stig and Barry again. Now that I know how 
	and what to ask, I find this technology amazing. And often 
	unexpectedly humorous. I asked Stig what he thought of Bill 
	Clinton. It went "He said he didn't inhale. What a wuss." I asked 
	about Hillary. It said, "Talk about a cover your ass marriage." 
</pre>
</i>
<p>
Generally people say things at the beginning of a conversation, 
especially with a stranger, to establish some kind of posture <a href="paper1_5.html#24">[24]</a> <a href="paper1_5.html#22">[22]</a>.
With a machine, however, many people begin with an adversarial posture
in order to "unmask" the computer -- almost as a defence mechanism against
the "deceptive" context imposed by a Turning Test.
<p>
At this point we can classify the general nature of people's reactions 
(and attitudes) toward a conversant machine:
<p>
<i>
<li>some administer a Turing Test by trying to determine if the agent is actually a computer program
<li>others use it as a medium to vent their ideas about how 
AI's should behave, as 
if the agent really cared
<li>some actually believe they are having "chat" with a real person
<li>a surprising number of people try to get the agent to engage
in sex with them
</i>
<p>
In this example, Barry is percieved as human for nearly 50 volleys:

Although the agent's responses are not always grammatically correct, 
the perception (and expectation) is that neither are many humans when
they type online.
<p>
Note that a trade-off has been made on grammar processing to render
the system more practical and responsive (fewer rules; less processing).
This affects a kind of "computer dialect", providing a humorous, ironic 
tone to the conversations (in English). The effect appears to attract
many regular correspondents.
<p>
Here's another conversation that went pretty well.

<b>
V. Conclusions
</b>
<p>
Overall, JFRED provides a natural language interface for Internet
software that can be described as:
<p>
<i>
<li>computer platform independent
<li>multi-threaded server, as a Java application
<li>fuzzy logic, rule-based AI
<li>frames-based learning
<li>language/dialect independent
</i>
<p>
The server supports a variety of front-end/client interfaces, including
direct telnet, HTML/CGI forms, Expect scripts, MOO bots, and Java applets
embedded in HTML pages, as well as standard I/O for testing.
<p>
One interesting consequence has been the use of the Barry DeFacto agent
as a front-end for a search engine. In conversation, people employ
the same nouns that they would use for a search query. We find that
fuzzy-logic rules operating on a conversational stream provides a
very efficient means of cataloguing a large Web site. The result 
appears more organized than a keyword search (e.g. Lycos or AltaVista
style search engines) and much less labor-intensive than a maintaining 
an ontology (e.g. the Yahoo search engine).
<p>
After observing interactions with several on-line FRED's, it is aparent that the personality of the bot is essential in keeping the users's interest and drawing them back into the conversation. Even the choice of colours/graphics can affect the human's reception of the bot.
<p>
We have experimented with combining the talents of writers, artists and
musicians (along with the required programmers) to evoke more empathy
toward a constructed "virtual personality". A science fiction writer,
Don Webb, was invited to develop a "history" for the agent, one based
on many references to pop culture, and which could then be reference
within the agent's conversation <a href="paper1_5.html#25">[25]</a>. The result combines a background
narrative with music (MIDI files) and graphic design to create an
aesthetic for the "robot" personality. We are now working to incorporate
a speech synthesizer into the generated stream of responses.
<p>
Current examples using the JFRED class library may be found on the <a href="fred.html">FRED</a> home page.
